# IAM Lab Project

This repository documents my hands-on work in **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**, focusing on real-world security practices using Microsoft Entra (Azure AD).

## 🔑 Topics Covered
- **Conditional Access (CA)** → Policy creation and enforcement.

- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** → App integration and authentication flows (OIDC / JWT.ms).  
- **Access Reviews** → Demonstrating governance and least-privilege.  
- **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** → Role assignment and just-in-time elevation.  

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **/evidence/** → Screenshots proving IAM configurations and lab results.  
- **README.md (this file)** → Overview of the entire project.  
- **evidence/README.md** → Detailed explanations of each screenshot and proof.  

## 🚀 Goal
This lab is part of my cybersecurity journey, building skills in IAM, access governance, and cloud security fundamentals to prepare for professional roles.
